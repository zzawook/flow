# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing Flutter mobile application to follow Flutter best practices and modern architectural patterns while maintaining 100% identical UI, behavior, and business logic. The refactoring will improve code maintainability, testability, and scalability without changing any user-facing functionality or visual appearance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flutter app to follow modern architectural patterns, so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the app SHALL use a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN examining the code structure THEN the app SHALL have distinct layers for presentation, domain, and data
3. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the app SHALL use proper dependency injection with clear interfaces
4. WHEN analyzing the state management THEN the app SHALL use a modern state management solution that follows Flutter best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code organization and structure, so that new features can be added more easily and existing code is easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the app SHALL have a logical folder organization that follows Flutter conventions
2. WHEN reviewing individual files THEN each file SHALL have a single responsibility and clear purpose
3. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the app SHALL use barrel exports to simplify import statements
4. WHEN examining widgets THEN complex widgets SHALL be broken down into smaller, reusable components
5. WHEN reviewing business logic THEN it SHALL be separated from UI components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to use modern Flutter patterns and packages, so that it leverages the latest best practices and community standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining state management THEN the app SHALL use either Riverpod, Bloc, or Provider instead of Redux
2. WHEN reviewing navigation THEN the app SHALL use GoRouter for type-safe navigation
3. WHEN analyzing dependency injection THEN the app SHALL use a modern DI solution like Riverpod or GetIt with proper abstractions
4. WHEN examining data models THEN the app SHALL use code generation for serialization (json_annotation, freezed)
5. WHEN reviewing async operations THEN the app SHALL use proper error handling and loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved testing capabilities, so that the app can be thoroughly tested and regressions can be prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code structure THEN business logic SHALL be easily testable in isolation
2. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN external dependencies SHALL be mockable for testing
3. WHEN analyzing widgets THEN UI components SHALL be testable with widget tests
4. WHEN examining the architecture THEN integration testing SHALL be possible without complex setup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to maintain identical functionality and appearance, so that my experience remains unchanged after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app after refactoring THEN all screens SHALL look identical to the original
2. WHEN interacting with the app THEN all user flows SHALL behave exactly the same
3. WHEN performing any action THEN the app SHALL respond identically to the original
4. WHEN navigating through the app THEN all transitions and animations SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN the app starts THEN the initialization process SHALL maintain the same behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly caught and handled at appropriate levels
2. WHEN examining error handling THEN there SHALL be consistent error handling patterns throughout the app
3. WHEN errors are displayed to users THEN they SHALL maintain the same user experience as the original
4. WHEN debugging THEN proper logging SHALL be available for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to follow Dart and Flutter coding standards, so that the code is consistent and follows community conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN it SHALL follow official Dart style guidelines
2. WHEN reviewing naming conventions THEN they SHALL be consistent and descriptive
3. WHEN analyzing code formatting THEN it SHALL be consistent throughout the project
4. WHEN examining documentation THEN public APIs SHALL be properly documented
5. WHEN reviewing lint rules THEN the app SHALL pass all recommended Flutter lints
