# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated transaction analysis system that processes transaction data using Amazon Bedrock AI services. When a Finverse data retrieval request completes, the system will automatically trigger analysis of unprocessed transactions to categorize them and extract card information, enhancing the user's financial data with intelligent insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically trigger transaction analysis when Finverse data retrieval completes, so that transaction data is processed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a FinverseDataRetrievalRequest is marked as complete THEN the system SHALL publish a message to a Kafka topic named "transaction-analysis-trigger"
2. WHEN the FinverseDataRetrievalRequest completion event is published THEN the message SHALL contain the user ID and institution ID for context
3. IF the FinverseDataRetrievalRequest completion fails to publish THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue normal operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system, I want to consume transaction analysis trigger events, so that I can process unanalyzed transactions automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is received on the "transaction-analysis-trigger" topic THEN the system SHALL consume the event and initiate transaction processing
2. WHEN consuming the trigger event THEN the system SHALL fetch all transaction history records where is_processed = false
3. IF no unprocessed transactions are found THEN the system SHALL log this information and complete processing
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL use Kafka's retry mechanism and log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system, I want to analyze transaction data using Amazon Bedrock, so that transactions can be automatically categorized and card information extracted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unprocessed transactions are found THEN the system SHALL send transaction details to Amazon Bedrock for analysis
2. WHEN sending to Bedrock THEN the system SHALL request categorization and card number extraction from transaction descriptions
3. WHEN Bedrock analysis completes THEN the system SHALL receive structured response containing category and card information
4. IF Bedrock analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and mark the transaction as processed with null values
5. WHEN Bedrock returns results THEN the system SHALL validate the response format before processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to store analyzed transaction data back to the database, so that the enriched information is available for user queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the transaction record with category and card information
2. WHEN updating transaction records THEN the system SHALL set is_processed = true to prevent reprocessing
3. WHEN storing analysis results THEN the system SHALL handle both successful analysis (with category/card data) and failed analysis (null values)
4. IF database update fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and allow Kafka retry mechanism to reprocess the message
5. WHEN all transactions in a batch are processed THEN the system SHALL commit the Kafka message acknowledgment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the transaction analysis pipeline, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in the analysis pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including transaction ID and error cause
2. WHEN Kafka message processing fails THEN the system SHALL not acknowledge the message to enable retry
3. WHEN Bedrock API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the SQL error and transaction details
5. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics of processed transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the transaction analysis feature to be configurable, so that I can adjust processing parameters without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration for Bedrock model ID, region, and API parameters
2. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL use configurable batch sizes for efficient processing
3. WHEN calling Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use configurable timeout and retry parameters
4. IF configuration values are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and log warnings
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime configuration updates where possible
